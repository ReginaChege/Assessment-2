// # **Ancestral Stories:** In many African cultures, the art of storytelling is passed
// # down from generation to generation. Imagine you're creating an application that
// # records these oral stories and translates them into different languages. The
// # stories vary by length, moral lessons, and the age group they are intended for.
// # Think about how you would model `Story`, `StoryTeller`, and `Translator`
// # objects, and how inheritance might come into play if there are different types of
// # stories or storytellers.
